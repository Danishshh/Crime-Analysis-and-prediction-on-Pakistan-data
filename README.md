# Description
This project contains Pakistan crime data, in this project you will get the analysis and Machine learning models for the prediction of the nature of the crime 
In the first part of the code i have done EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand the data and the variables. 
In the next part i have trained different models of Machine learning, Models and there accuracy are given below:

Decision Tree	                      0.995844
Gradient boosting classifier	      0.991169
Random Forest	                      0.984935
SVM	                                0.981299
KNN                                	0.938701
LR	                                0.881558

In this project you'll get different visuaization for your understanding and presentation on the project.
