Bara: The militants belonging to Lashkar-i-Islam [LI] shot dead three supporters of another group in Sepah area of Bara Tehsil [sub-division] in Khyber Agency, local sources said on Thursday [24 February].

The sources said that some militants belonging to Lashkar-e-Islam forced their entry into a house in Yousaf Talab area of Bara and dragged out three supporters of commander Nazir from the house and shot them dead at a deserted place. Commander Nazir Afridi is leading a renegade group of the Tehrik-e-Taleban Pakistan [TTP] in the area. The dead were identified as Gul Rahim, Saifullah and Nasir.

The sources added that commander Nazir and LI head Mangal Bagh belonged to the Sepah Afridi tribe and the former was expelled by the latter from Bara Tehsil some three years back after he refused to disconnect his ties with the TTP.

After his expulsion from Bara, Nazir Afridi shifted to Orakzai Agency and formed his own group. Two men of LI were killed in a clash triggered by militants attack on the convoy of security forces in Yousaf Talab on Wednesday.
